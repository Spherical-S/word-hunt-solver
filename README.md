# Word Hunt Solver
An app to help you cheat in the game pigeon word hunt game.

Doesn't work that well in practice because of word hunts 1 minute time limit
but it is helpful to get those big words for massive amounts of points.

# How To Run
Just download all files in the repository and run main.py
```
python main.py
```
From there it will ask you to enter the board, so enter the board
from left to right, row by row from top to bottom. For eg
if the board is as follows, you write "abcdefghijklmnop"

ABCD
EFGH
IJKL
MNOP

The app will output the biggest words at the bottom, if you are
confused on how to get the word, put the number corresponding
to the word in the GUI application for a "map" on how to get the
word.

Please note that word hunt does not have an official list of words that work
so a some of the words that the app gives you will not work when you type it
in game.

This app is not associated with Word Hunt's or Game Pigeon's developers at all.
